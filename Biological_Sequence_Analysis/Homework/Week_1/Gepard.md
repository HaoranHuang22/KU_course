  **Furin-like**: The furin-like cysteine rich region has been found in a variety of proteins from eukaryotes that are involved in the mechanism of signal transduction by receptor tyrosine kinases.

  **PK_Tyr_Ser-Thr**: The Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) family of cell surface receptors shows a high affinity to numerous growth signals. Although numerous intracellular signaling pathways are shared following activation of the receptors by ligand, the responses may be tightly regulated by ligand-receptor specificity or through variations in responses to specific receptors â€“ the one receptor may induce differing results following stimulation depending on the cell type in which the receptor is expressed.

  Almost same pattern, and the dog one has the sequence insertion.
